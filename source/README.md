# Azure Infrastructure Operations Project: Deploying a scalable IaaS web server in Azure

### Introduction
This project will deploy a scalable cluster of servers using Terraform tempate and server image from Packer.
### Getting Started
1. Clone this repository

2. Set up environment variables to access your azure account

3. Modify vars.tf if needed

4. Run packer image script

5. Run terraform script

### Dependencies
1. Create an [Azure Account](https://portal.azure.com) 
2. Install the [Azure command line interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
3. Install [Packer](https://www.packer.io/downloads)
4. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

### Instructions
1. Create your azure account, subscription, resource group for the image. If the account and subscription already exist create the resource group only. Make sure the name matches the "managed_image_resource_group_name" in server.json and vars.tf

2. Add the following environment variables: 

ARM_CLIENT_ID
ARM_CLIENT_SECRET
ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
ARM_TENANT_ID

To make in more consistent create a file like "env.settings" and save your varibles. Source them once you open the terminal. 

3. Update the packer file server.json with your region, storage and resource name. Storage might differ from region to region. 

4. Update the vars.tf file with your information. vars.tf contains default values for vm's usernames and password, resource name and location, default number of machines, packer image name and packer resource group. 

5. Run the fopllowing command to create the server image. Make sure it uses existing resource group  

packer build server.json

6. Run the following command to update packer. Make sure to add the created folder to gitignore

terraform init

7. Run the following command to check deployment plan and save it to a file. 

terraform plan -out solution.plan

8. Run the following command to deploy the infrastructure

terraform apply 

9. Destroy the infrustructure if needed: 

terraform destroy

### Output
Once the plan is created you will get output similar to that : 

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Plan: 16 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
